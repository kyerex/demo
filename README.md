# demo
these demos are to be run from the htmltty psuedo-terminal

see the Demo-Readme.pdf for instructions

all code is mine except for the base64 encoding
I am using:

https://github.com/zhicheng/base64

/* This is a public domain base64 implementation written by WEI Zhicheng. */

so I think it should be okay to use in an MIT license - I'm new to the open source licensing

Thanks Ken Yerex
